## I'm having trouble updating this site at the moment

This post shouldn't appear at all unless the problem is solved :)

I've added a few presentations from recent lectures and I'm trying to upload them to the site, but after updateing the repository, they won't deploy. I don't know why. After some research into to issue I sent github support an email. 

Now I'm using prose.io in order to post a new Jekyll post to the blog and see whether the blog is updated. Let's see what happens...
