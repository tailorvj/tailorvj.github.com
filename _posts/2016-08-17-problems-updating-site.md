## I'm having trouble updating this site at the moment

Update: I got a build warning email saying my Jekyll is using pygments highlighter instead of rouge, so I edited config.yml to fix that. Now editing this post to see if it triggers a site update

Now I'm using prose.io in order to post a new Jekyll post to the blog and see whether the blog is updated. Let's see what happens...
